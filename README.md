# CheckMeIn
TLDR; a mobile app that lets you check into places ahead of time, with generated qr code/id to match the place, and pre-fill in any COVID related questions. can be used for restaurants and hospitals. answers refresh/update every 12 hours.

the user facing one to check in and then a side for like the establishment so like when I check in, it will generate a QR code and the establishment just has to scan it and then they’ll see all my information on their side, therefore less contact and wait time for both parties

so like I could have my vaccination receipts/passports already uploaded on my profile and then you know like the typical questions, they all ask the same questions so I could fill it in for those places and then select like the places I’m trying to check into

the only thing that would be saved is the vaccination status, which can then be updated to include a boost if someone has gotten that. every 12 hours the answers would reset so they have to answer it every day/closer to the time they want to go out to these places
the booster can honestly just be like a checkbox on their profile type of thing.
