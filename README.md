Have you ever been hanging out with friends and want to get food, but don’t know where to eat? Then this is the app for YOU. The app helps groups of people to find restaurants in their area, through “tinder style” swiping (left for no, right for yes). If everyone in the group swipes right on one restaurant, your group is ready to eat!  
 
We are building an app that helps people to coordinate restaurant choice for dine in/take out. Users can form a “group” in the app on their own phones and are each presented with restaurant/eatery options. Users swipe through (right if they would be willing to eat there, left if they would not). When the same restaurant is swiped right on by the majority of people in the group it is a “Compromise”. Once everyone has “swiped right” on the same restaurant, swiping stops and the “Chosen” restaurant is presented to all users in the group. In the event no consensus has been reached after a set amount of time, a ranked (by popularity) list is instead presented to the users.
