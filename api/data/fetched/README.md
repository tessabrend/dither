# Fetched Data

This folder will contain a list of files similar in format to the sample data, with the exception that instead of being static data loaded into the database for testing purposes, the files in this folder will represent data fetched from the google places API for the purpose of setting up restaurant matching groups.

Of course, right now the only file here will be Restaurants.json (it should not be checked in to version control), but if we add any table which need to be fetched, they can be added here as well.
